# Activity 3.1

SDLC \(Software development life cycle \) is used to develop or redesign high quality software. During discussion in classroom and looking at the diagram it shows that SDLC acts as a guider of the  project  to meet the clients requirements. According to my understanding ,it provides a framework for a standard set of activity. It ensures to provide correct and timely delivery to the client .Then main thing is it breaks down the entire life cycle of software development thus make is easier to evaluate each part of software development and also makes it easier for programmers to work concurrently on each phase.Moreover, **SDLC**, is not a technical document â€“ rather it's a process document
